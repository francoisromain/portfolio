Description: LSCM provides supply chain management services for major oil companies operating in Nigeria. The Clear application supports their business and  tracks orders, shipments, boxes and any piece of hardware used in the building of off-shore rigs, from factories worldwide to the assembly location.

Keypoints: 
- The single page application connects to a REST API for the operators and the clients to follow and update the tracking informations. 
- The responsive interface is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, and also TV screens which display dashboards inside control rooms.
- Many KPI and graphs are generated with D3 and NvD3.
- In addition, a native android mobile application allows the operators,  working in warehouses with no internet coverage, to scan QR code and transmit data via SMS.
