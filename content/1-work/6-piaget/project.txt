Type: website

Description: During a couple of years, I worked on most the web projects of Piaget, the swiss watches and jewelry maker, including promotional films, animations and their main website. A great achievement was to convince them to switch from Flash to HTML for their new international website, which, back in 2009, was a bold decision for a luxury brand. During almost a year, I helped them to specify their need, designed the website and worked closely with our engineering team to define the new architecture.

Keypoints:
- The website is available in nine languages. 
- The catalog showcases about 400 pieces and the store finder about 500 stores. 
- The website administration allow a team to translate the content and specific administrators can then publish it on twelve different geographical areas.
