Keypoints: 

- The complete solution relies only on open-source and self-hosted technologies. 
- A custom responsive layout offers a unified experience from mobile to desktop. 
- A special attention is made to optimize loading time (reducing files size and number of http requests) by rewriting all Prestashop javascript code and sharing assets with Kirby.
- A pre-production environnement allows administrators of the website to safely test and validate modifications before publication.
- The e-mailing system stores data locally while e-mails are sent individually using Amazon SES (reliable and trusted as non-spam).
