Description: Sessun.com is a fully featured website for a fashion brand, including a catalogue, an e-commerce platform, a blog, an email marketing solution, and analytics, available in french and english. I designed and developed the full solution. 

---- 

Keypoints: 

- The complete solution relies only on open-source and self-hosted technologies. 
- A custom responsive layout offers a unified experience from mobile to desktop. 
- Special attention is given to loading-time optimization (reducing files size and number of http requests) by rewriting all Prestashop javascript code and sharing assets with Kirby.
- A pre-production environment allows administrators of the website to safely test and validate modifications before publication.
- The emailing system stores data locally while emails are sent individually using Amazon SES, ensuring that each email is trusted as non-spam.
