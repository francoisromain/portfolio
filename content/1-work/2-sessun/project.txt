Description: Sessun.com is a fully-featured website for the fashion brand, including catalogue, e-commerce, blog, e-mailing and statistics, available in french and english.

---- 

Keypoints: 

- The complete solution relies only on open-source and self-hosted technologies: Kirby for the catalog and blog, Prestashop for the e-commerce, and Piwik for the statistics. 
- The website offers a unified experience from mobile to desktop thanks to a custom responsive layout. 
- A special attention is made to optimize loading time (reducing files size and number of http requests) by rewriting all Prestashop default javascript and sharing assets with Kirby.
- A pre-production environnement allows administrators of the website to safely test and validate modifications before publication.
- The e-mailing system stores data locally while e-mails are sent individually using Amazon SES (reliable and trusted as non-spam).
