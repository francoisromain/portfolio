Description: Data Cycles displays a simulated real-time visualization, as well as statistics and predictive analytics, using a yearâ€™s worth of Bay Area Bike Share data. Four people worked on this project, and my role was to design and develop the interactive map with D3 and integrate the front-end. 

----

Keypoints: 
- An interactive animated map built with D3 displays between 500 and 1000 animated elements on one page. 
- Approximately 30 million records stored in database (information about every bike trip over a one-year period).
